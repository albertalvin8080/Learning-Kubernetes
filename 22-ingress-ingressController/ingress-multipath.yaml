    #   specified path (like /testpath) will be rewritten to / before being forwarded to the backend service.
    # For example, if a client sends a request to http://your-domain.com/testpath/somepage, the request that the 
    #   backend service receives will be http://your-domain.com/somepage, because the /testpath has been rewritten to /.
