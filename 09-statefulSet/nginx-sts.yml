# -> Independent Storage: Each pod in the StatefulSet has its own PVC. Any changes made to the volume are specific to the PVC associated with the pod that made the change.
# -> Stateful Pods, Not Shared Storage: While StatefulSets ensure pod order and maintain a unique identifier, they don't inherently provide shared storage across containers within the StatefulSet.
